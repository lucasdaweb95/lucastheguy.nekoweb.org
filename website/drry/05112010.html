        <p>	Hello, diary! im writing this diary since my psychologist asked to help me to express some emotions and headaches I've had.</p>
        
        <p> I got you for christmas early!! My dad works for tech so he thought of making this little digital diary for me!
        (He didn't think I'd find out before christmas.. I know a little too you know!! hehehe)</p>
        
        <p> We barely know each other... so how about I introduce myself!</p>
        
        <p> I'm Nelly, but my username online is "pepthebest", look it up!! My birthday is also just in a week! It got here so fast. Barely feels like it's been a whole year since i turned 14! </p>
        
        <p> I'm learning coding with my dad and gardening with my mom, I can't spend alot of time with my dad since he has to work alot at some tech company, so i spend most of the day at my mom's flower shop.</p>
        
        <p> My dad teaches me coding every weekend since that's when he has time to stay at home.</p>
        
        <p> In terms of tech i only have a flip phone and my dad's old iPod. i asked for a phone this christmas since my flip phone is FINALLY starting to break. my dad really hates upgrading stuff so thank god he has a work PC I can play on because its actually really fast!!!</p>
        
        <p> But only on weekends though because i don't know the password... In the week days i get to use the family laptop but it can't do anything, so i just use it for looking at newgrounds when my parents arent watching >:)</p>
        
        <p> Anyways, thats all i have for today. I'll catch up with you later!! Goodbye diary :P</p>
